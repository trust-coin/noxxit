Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully.

After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.\u00a0 If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.\u00a0 The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either party is entitled.<\/p><p><strong><b>Arbitration Rules.<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.\u00a0 If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.\u00a0 The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.\u00a0 The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\u00a0 The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.\u00a0 Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.\u00a0 For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.\u00a0 Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.\u00a0 If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u00a0 If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.\u00a0 Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.<\/p><p><strong><b>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and\/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.\u00a0 The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.<\/p><p><strong><b>Time Limits.<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and\/or demanded within the statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.<\/p><p><strong><b>Authority of Arbitrator.<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\u00a0 The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.\u00a0 The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.\u00a0 The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\u00a0 The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\u00a0 The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.<\/p><p><strong><b>Waiver of Jury Trial.<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.\u00a0 Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\u00a0 In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.<\/p><p><strong><b>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.<\/p><p><strong><b>Confidentiality.<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be strictly confidential.\u00a0 The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.\u00a0 This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.<\/p><p><strong><b>Severability.<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.<\/p><p><strong><b>Right to Waive.<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.\u00a0 Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.<\/p><p><strong><b>Survival of Agreement.<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.<\/p><p><strong><b>Small Claims Court.<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.<\/p><p><strong><b>Emergency Equitable Relief.<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0Anyhow the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.\u00a0 A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.<\/p><p><strong><b>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party\u2019s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.<\/p><p>In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Netherlands County, California, for such purposes.<\/p><p>The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.
